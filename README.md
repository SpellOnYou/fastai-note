# dlpt-note-practice

### branch explanation

- Jeremy: To follow up new updates from [course-v3](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3)

- Dionne: To include my own notes, and as (randomly) colab has [released P100 GPUs now](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/duds5d/d_colab_has_p100_gpus/), I will use colab, not aws (actually, I'm already out of budget ðŸ˜­)
