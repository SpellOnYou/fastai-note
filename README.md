# dlpt-note-practice

### branch explanation

- Jeremy: To follow up new updates from [course-v3](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3)

- Dionne: To include my own notes, and as (randomly) colab has [released P100 GPUs now](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/duds5d/d_colab_has_p100_gpus/), I will use colab, not aws (actually, I'm already out of budget ðŸ˜­)

### Tips from part1

* Donâ€™t try to stop and understand everything.
* Donâ€™t waste your time, learn Jupyter keyboard shortcuts. Learn 4 to 5 each day.
* Please run the code, really run the code. Donâ€™t go deep on theory. Play with the code, see what goes in and what comes out.
* Pick one project. Do it really well. Make it fantastic.
* Run this notebook (lesson1-pets.ipynb), but then get your own dataset and run it! (extra emphasis: do this!)
