### Tips from part1

* Donâ€™t try to stop and understand everything.
* Donâ€™t waste your time, learn Jupyter keyboard shortcuts. Learn 4 to 5 each day.
* Please run the code, really run the code. Donâ€™t go deep on theory. Play with the code, see what goes in and what comes out.
* Pick one project. Do it really well. Make it fantastic.
* Run this notebook (lesson1-pets.ipynb), but then get your own dataset and run it! (extra emphasis: do this!)
